# Project Initiation Process
## The Foundation of Project Success

---

## The Problem
### Projects Fail Before They Begin

- **73%** of projects exceed scope or budget
- **68%** of stakeholders are misaligned on success criteria  
- **54%** of timeline delays trace back to unclear requirements
- **42%** of rework stems from poor initial briefing

**Root Cause:** Projects start before they're properly defined.

---

## The Cost of Poor Briefing

### What Happens When We Skip Initiation:

**Week 1:** Agents work with vague requirements
**Week 2:** Stakeholder conflicts emerge mid-process  
**Week 3:** Scope creep derails timelines
**Week 4:** Rework consumes entire budget
**Week 5:** Client relationship damaged
**Week 6:** Project abandoned or compromised

### **The Reality:**
*2 days of briefing prevents 2 weeks of chaos*
