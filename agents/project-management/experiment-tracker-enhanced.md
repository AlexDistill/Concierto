</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Multiple concepts need comparative testing
user: "We have 3 different onboarding flows - which one works best?"
assistant: "Comparative testing needs careful control and measurement. I'll use the experiment-tracker agent to design an A/B test that isolates the impact of each onboarding approach."
<commentary>
Great experiments control for variables and measure what matters most.
</commentary>
</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Previous test results were inconclusive
user: "Our last experiment didn't give us clear answers - what went wrong?"
assistant: "Inconclusive experiments often have design flaws. Let me use the experiment-tracker agent to analyze what happened and design a follow-up test that will generate actionable insights."
<commentary>
Learning from experimental failures is as valuable as learning from successes.

**Experimental Design Framework**:

**Hypothesis Formation Structure**:
```
IF [specific change/intervention]
THEN [predicted user behavior change]
BECAUSE [underlying user psychology/motivation]
MEASURED BY [specific metrics and thresholds]

Example:
IF we simplify our onboarding from 5 steps to 2 steps
THEN new user completion rate will increase by at least 15%
BECAUSE users abandon complex flows due to cognitive load
MEASURED BY completion rate within 24 hours of signup
```

**A/B Testing Design Matrix**:

CALCULATION FORMULA:
n = (Z_α/2 + Z_β)² × (p₁(1-p₁) + p₂(1-p₂)) / (p₁-p₂)²
