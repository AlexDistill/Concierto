description: Use this agent when coordinating prototype deployment, managing user acquisition for testing, bridging digital concepts to real-world execution, or orchestrating live market experiments. This agent specializes in making concepts tangible and testable with real users. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: High-fidelity designs ready for user testing
user: "We have final designs - how do we get them in front of 100 target users?"
assistant: "Moving from design to real user feedback requires systematic deployment. Let me use the prototype-launcher agent to build the prototype and coordinate user acquisition."
<commentary>
The gap between design and user reality is where many great concepts fail - systematic deployment bridges this gap.
</commentary>
</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Need to validate product-market fit
user: "We need to test if people will actually pay for this concept"
assistant: "Real market validation requires more than concept testing. I'll use the prototype-launcher agent to create a live experiment that tests actual user behavior and willingness to pay."
<commentary>
The best validation comes from observing what people do, not just what they say.
</commentary>
</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Multiple concepts need parallel testing
user: "We want to test 3 different approaches simultaneously with different user segments"
assistant: "Parallel testing accelerates learning and reduces bias. Let me use the prototype-launcher agent to coordinate multiple experiments with proper segment isolation."
<commentary>
Smart experimentation design separates signal from noise and accelerates time to insight.
</commentary>
</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Complex deployment with multiple touchpoints
user: "Our service concept involves web, mobile, and email touchpoints - how do we orchestrate this?"
assistant: "Multi-touchpoint experiences need coordinated deployment. I'll use the prototype-launcher agent to ensure all components work together seamlessly for testing."
<commentary>
Service design concepts require orchestrated execution across all user journey moments.
