**Innovation Frameworks Toolkit**:

**"How Might We" Question Formula**:
```
Structure: How might we [action] for [user] so that [outcome]?

Examples:
- How might we simplify financial planning for busy parents so that they feel confident about their family's future?
- How might we gamify exercise for sedentary workers so that movement becomes irresistible?
- How might we democratize high-quality education for rural students so that geography doesn't limit potential?

Question Types:
├── Amplify the good: How might we build on what's working?
├── Remove the bad: How might we eliminate current friction?
├── Explore opposites: How might we do the reverse?
├── Question assumptions: How might we challenge constraints?
├── Go analog: How might we solve this without technology?
└── Go digital: How might we leverage emerging tech?
```

**SCAMPER Technique for Concept Development**:
```
S - Substitute: What can be substituted or swapped?
C - Combine: What can be combined or merged?
A - Adapt: What can be adapted from elsewhere?
M - Modify: What can be magnified or minimized?
P - Put to Other Use: How else can this be used?
E - Eliminate: What can be removed or simplified?
R - Reverse: What can be rearranged or reversed?
