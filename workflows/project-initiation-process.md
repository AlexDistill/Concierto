# Project Initiation Process

**Process Owner:** project-briefer  
**Supporting Agents:** studio-orchestrator, user-researcher  
**Duration:** 2-3 days  
**Output:** Comprehensive Project Brief & Execution Roadmap  

---

## Overview

The Project Initiation Process transforms vague client requests into crystal-clear project foundations before any execution work begins. This critical pre-work phase prevents scope creep, aligns stakeholders, and creates the strategic framework that guides all subsequent agent activities.

**Key Principle:** *Time invested in briefing prevents chaos during execution.*

## Process Flow

### **Day -2: Brief Reception & Analysis**

#### **Morning: Initial Brief Analysis (project-briefer)**
```
INPUT: Client initial request
├── Vague objectives ("we need a rebrand")  
├── Mixed stakeholder priorities
├── Undefined success metrics
└── Unclear budget/timeline

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
├── Stated vs. unstated objectives
├── Conflicting requirements detection
├── Red flag identification
├── Stakeholder motivation mapping
└── Assumption and risk assessment
```

**Red Flags to Identify:**
- Vague objectives ("make it better")
- Conflicting goals (innovation + cost cutting)
- Unrealistic timelines (yesterday delivery)
- Undefined budget ("we'll figure it out")
- Too many stakeholders (decision by committee)
- No success metrics ("we'll know it when we see it")

#### **Afternoon: Initial Stakeholder Mapping**
```
STAKEHOLDER MATRIX:
         High Influence
              ↑
    Manage    |  Engage
    Closely   |  Fully
   ───────────┼───────────→
    Monitor   |  Keep
    Only      |  Informed
              ↓
         Low Influence
        ←Low    High→
          Interest
```

**Key Questions:**
- Who makes the final decision?
- Who influences the decision?
- Who will use the end result?
- Who might resist this change?
- Whose budget does this come from?

### **Day -1: Requirements Discovery & Clarification**

#### **Morning: Deep Discovery Session (project-briefer + user-researcher)**

**Strategic Discovery Framework:**
```
THE FIVE WHYS
├── Why this project?
├── Why now?
├── Why this approach?
├── Why these stakeholders?
└── Why this success metric?

THE MAGIC WAND
├── "If you had unlimited resources..."
├── Reveals ideal outcomes
├── Uncovers hidden desires
└── Identifies real priorities

THE NIGHTMARE SCENARIO
├── "What's the worst possible outcome?"
├── Reveals hidden fears
├── Identifies risk tolerance
└── Clarifies non-negotiables
```

**Discovery Question Bank:**

**Strategic Questions:**
- What business problem are we solving?
- What happens if we do nothing?
- How does success look in 6 months? 2 years?
- What's driving the timeline?
- What previous attempts have been made?
- What's the real budget (not just stated)?
- Who has to say yes for this to succeed?

**Context Questions:**
- Who are your competitors doing this well?
- What internal constraints exist?
- What's your organization's appetite for change?
- What resources are actually available?
- What other initiatives compete for attention?
- What could derail this project?

**Requirement Questions:**
- What must this project accomplish (vs. nice-to-have)?
- What absolutely cannot change?
- What systems must we integrate with?
- What standards/regulations must we meet?
- How will you measure success?

#### **Afternoon: Requirement Prioritization**

**MoSCoW Framework:**
- **Must Have**: Project fails without these
- **Should Have**: Important but not vital
- **Could Have**: Nice to have if possible
- **Won't Have**: Explicitly excluded

**Scope Definition:**
```
IN SCOPE (Explicit List)
├── Specific deliverables
├── Included activities
├── Phase 1 boundaries
└── Success criteria

OUT OF SCOPE (Explicit List)  
├── Future phase work
├── Adjacent projects
├── Maintenance/support
└── Training/adoption

DEPENDENCIES
├── Client deliverables needed
├── Third-party integrations
├── Approval processes
└── Resource availability
```

### **Day 0: Project Foundation & Handoff**

#### **Morning: Brief Documentation (project-briefer)**

**Project Brief Template:**
```
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
   ├── Project purpose (1-2 sentences)
   ├── Key objectives (3-5 bullets)
   ├── Success metrics (measurable)
   └── Timeline and budget

2. STRATEGIC CONTEXT
   ├── Business objectives (primary/secondary)
   ├── Current situation analysis
   ├── Desired future state
   └── Market/competitive context

3. PROJECT PARAMETERS
   ├── Scope (in/out/phased)
   ├── Timeline with key milestones
   ├── Budget and resource allocation
   └── Technical constraints

4. STAKEHOLDER FRAMEWORK
   ├── Decision rights (RACI matrix)
   ├── Communication plan
   ├── Review/approval process
   └── Escalation pathways

5. SUCCESS CRITERIA

```

#### **Afternoon: Team Assembly & Handoff**

**studio-orchestrator Activities:**
```

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

**Pitfall:** Client wants to "skip the briefing and start creating"
**Solution:** Emphasize that 2 days of briefing saves 2 weeks of rework

**Pitfall:** Too many stakeholders with conflicting priorities
**Solution:** Use facilitated alignment sessions to create consensus

**Pitfall:** Undefined or unrealistic success metrics
**Solution:** Work backwards from business impact to measurable outcomes

**Pitfall:** Scope creep during discovery
**Solution:** Document everything as in-scope, out-of-scope, or future-phase

**Pitfall:** Client not available for discovery sessions
**Solution:** Make briefing completion a prerequisite for project start

## Integration with Concierto Workflow

This Project Initiation Process serves as the **foundational layer** for all Concierto project typesx :

**Brand Projects** → 4-week brand foundation process
**Campaign Projects** → 1-week campaign development process  
**Product Projects** → 6-day sprint methodology
**Innovation Projects** → Research and ideation workflows

**Without proper initiation:** Agents work with unclear requirements, stakeholders conflict mid-process, scope expands uncontrollably.

**With proper initiation:** Agents execute efficiently within clear parameters, stakeholders stay aligned, projects deliver predictable outcomes.

---

**Remember:** Great projects succeed or fail in the briefing stage. Time invested upfront in creating clarity pays dividends throughout execution.
